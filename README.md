## License

Dual licensing under both MIT and Apache-2.0 is the currently accepted standard by the Rust language community and has been used for both the compiler and many public libraries since (see https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.6.0/complement-project-faq.html#why-dual-mitasl2-license). In order to match the community standards, webrtc-rs is using the dual MIT+Apache-2.0 license.
